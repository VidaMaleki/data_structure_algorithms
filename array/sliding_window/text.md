## Sliding Window
The Sliding Window pattern is a common technique used to optimize problems involving subarrays or substrings by maintaining a "window" that slides through the input data. It helps reduce nested loops, making solutions more efficient, often reducing time complexity from O(NÂ²) to O(N).

### How Sliding Window Works
- Fixed-size window: When the window size is given.
- Variable-size window: When the window size depends on a condition.
